## Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Back Story

An email from a potential client:

> Vinny & Rita -
>
> It was great to meet with you and chat at the event where we recently met and had a nice chat. We’d love to take some next steps to see if working together is something that would make sense for both parties.
>
> As we mentioned, we are interested in harnessing the power of data and analytics to optimize the effectiveness of our street team work, which is a significant portion of our fundraising efforts.
>
> WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year. As we are new and inclusive organization, we try to do double duty with the gala both to fill our event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach.
>
> To this end we place street teams at entrances to subway stations. The street teams collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent free tickets to our gala.
>
> Where we’d like to solicit your engagement is to use MTA subway data, which as I’m sure you know is available freely from the city, to help us optimize the placement of our street teams, such that we can gather the most signatures, ideally from those who will attend the gala and contribute to our cause.
>
> The ball is in your court now—do you think this is something that would be feasible for your group? From there we can explore what kind of an engagement would make sense for all of us.
>
> Best,
>
> Karrine and Dahlia
>
> WTWY International

 Hint: If you want more info on what "additional work" looks like, check out our [project rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oAJrWNR7HxNJVI2IHUuHArEvBccowLqvPObYbqtH0rs/edit). Nothing beyond EDA and viz is required, but if you have any extra time, go for it! Groups work at different paces, so don't worry if you don't get to this.


* [Project Starter for Project 1](https://github.com/thisismetis/onl_ds5/tree/main/project_starters/questions/project_1_starter)
  * Use these questions to help get you going on your project.
* [Project 1 Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vi2JkqC70IAbuhDpi5THGe2keV3_E-EoovI5ZxwpmyQ/edit#)
* [Project 1 Worksheet submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1v6evG8IfAYbaEBNm2UQEBPV0sttlW0ZubnlQVKdw0zc/edit?usp=sharing)
  * This is a diffrent form than the one you will usually use; only use this one for this project and not in the future
  * Only one person per group needs to submit
* [Follow the Submission Guide for slides and code](https://github.com/thisismetis/onl_ds5/blob/main/submissions.md)
  * This is the process that you'll regularly use to submit work
  * One person per group needs to submit slides
  * Each group member should submit the same repo or notebook with code from all group members

## Workflow

For other projects, your workflow will be pretty complex. For this project, you want to... 
* start with questions and goals
* clean your data
* do exploratory data analysis related to your answering questions and accomplishing your goals 
* evaluate whether your questions are answered and goals accomplished
* if not, do more exploratory data analysis and reevaluate (iterate) until you can say that you have an MVP
* and finally, put all of this into a presentation


---

## Presentation Tips


* Emphasize how your analysis connects back to the business use case, i.e. WTWY's problem
* Think about having one final takeaways or conclusion slide
* Make your conclusions actionable (e.g. If I have 20 people, where should I send them specifically?) and relatable (e.g. How much more traffic is there on one day as oppoosed to another? How many times the volume?) 
* Only present work that supports answering and accomplishing your preestablished questions and goals
* Emphasize what you found rather than the nitty gritty details of how you found it

We are very excited to see what you will learn and do for Project 1!
