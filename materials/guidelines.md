## Setting up the Project

What are the goals of your analysis? Be as specific as possible (Hint: what WTWY’s goals?)


Ok, now look at those goals and take your thoughts a step further. Can you make those goals even more detailed?


How will you address those goals? Write down the specific steps and/or analytical tools you will use for each goal.


Brainstorm what else you could do for this project. One example might be adding another data source, but what else can you come up with? What additional steps would enhance your analysis?


What are steps you will take while you go through this project? What is your process? For example, one step would be to make a presentation. What might come before and after that?

## Setting up Group Work

How often will your group check in? Set a schedule.


How will your group check in?


How will you share what you’re working on? (e.g. through a GitHub repo, verbally through check-ins, etc)


Look above at what you designated as the steps of the project. Who will be responsible for which steps or tasks? How will you divide up your work? 


Don’t neglect the communication part of this project: think about how each part of your work with data will flow into a presentation and who will be doing which part of the presenting.


When should each task be completed?


Establish group norms. Are there any ground rules you should all follow? How will you fruitfully address any conflict that might arise?

## A Few Tips

You probably want to start off by looking at the project starter for this project. It will help you to clean your data and start EDA.

If you have a favorite slide template, definitely use that, but if you don’t, check out Slide Carnival. They have lots of professional templates.

Think about what holes someone could poke in your analysis. You don’t necessarily have to address every potential issue in your work, but you should be aware of potential drawbacks and should be ready to discuss them!
